About the app.+
This application was developed in NetBeans as a JAX web service app using the Maven framework (Java EE 7, NB 8, JDK 1.0.8_25+). It is designed to work with a separate client application which accesses the web service remotely through WSDL files. Separate branches of this repo will be created. One contains a console based client (with menu), the other contains a GUI. The GUI version contains all the functionality of the console based client.+
